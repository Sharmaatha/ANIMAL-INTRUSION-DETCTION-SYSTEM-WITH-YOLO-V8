🐾 ANIMAL INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM USING YOLOv8


This project enables real-time detection of wildlife animals using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. It aims to assist in forest monitoring and conservation by identifying dangerous animals and sending alerts through siren sounds and SMS notifications via Twilio.

🚀 Features
Real-time animal detection using webcam
Alerts via siren when dangerous animals are detected
SMS alerts sent to rangers using Twilio API
Easily customizable for different animal types or alert systems


📦 Requirements
Python 3.x
Ultralytics YOLOv8
OpenCV (cv2)
pygame (for siren sound)
python-dotenv (for environment variables)
twilio (for sending SMS alerts)
